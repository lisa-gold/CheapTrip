// It is form where users choose 2 cities, click 'let's go' or 'cancel' and routes are displayed

// It forms 2 lists of cities to choose from (drop-list). It uses locations.json to build these cities lists
// It builds routes using flying_routes, fixed_routes, common_routes (fake db for development phase ??)

// ? forming lists and forming routes should be separated into different components
